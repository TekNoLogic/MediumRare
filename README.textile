MediumRare is a simple rare NPC finder, inspired by "_NPCScan":http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12995-_NPCScan.html

MediumRare uses the game's cache to detect when a mob spawns.  If you run into a hunter that has a rare pet it will trigger the alert.  If you've already seen a mob that you have not killed (according to the achievements), MediumRare will give you instructions on how to clear the cache.

Old-world rare mobs are not supported, as there are no achievements for them.
